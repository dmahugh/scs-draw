                  SCS-DRAW USER'S GUIDE ADDENDUM


ONLINE HELP SCREENS FOR NEW FEATURES IN SCS-DRAW 1.1:

Version 1.1 of SCS-Draw includes a variety of new commands to help you
create and print images.  Also, several commands from Draw 1.0 have been
enhanced.  These new commands and enhancements are described in Help
Screens that you can view while you are using SCS-Draw.  To view the
Help Screens for the new features, press H from the sketchpad.  Then
follow the instructions on the screen for moving through the Help Screens.

DIFFERENT PRINTER SELECTIONS:

For some printer models, you need to use a different printer selection
in Draw 1.1 than you used in Draw 1.0.

    IF YOUR PRINTER MODEL IS          USE THIS PRINTER SELECTION
      Star Gemini (all models)          Epson MX-80
      Hewlett-Packard 2225 Thinkjet     Epson MX-80
      Epson RX-80                       Epson MX-80
      Epson RX-100                      Epson FX,LX,LQ series

USING SETDRAW:

The SETDRAW program installs your printer as the default in Draw. 
Be sure to make a working copy of the SCS-Draw Master Disk before
you use SETDRAW.  Then run SETDRAW on your working copy to set your
printer as the default printer.  You should NOT run SETDRAW or make
any other modifications to the Draw programs on the original Master Disk.

CUSTOM PRINTER INSTALLATION:

Most printers can use one of the printer selections provided with Draw.
To set the default printer for one of these printer selections, you
need only run SETDRAW, select the printer type, and press RETURN.

In Draw 1.1, SETDRAW also offers a Custom Printer Installation option.
If your printer does not work with any of the standard printer 
installations, you can customize a printer selection. You must know
the control codes your printer requires to print graphics. If you run
SETDRAW and select the Custom Printer Installation, the program gives
instructions for setting the printer control codes to the codes your
printer requires.

MAKING A WORKING COPY OF DRAW (on double-sided drives):

SCS-Draw is provided on a single-sided disk, so that it can be used with
any model of Kaypro computer.  If your Kaypro has double-sided drives,
you need to use a procedure specifically designed for making a double-sided
working copy from a single-sided SCS-Draw Master Disk.  If you have
double-sided disk drives (as used on the 4'84, New 2, and 2X), follow
the procedure in Appendix E, "Making a Working Copy," on pages 87-88
of the SCS-Draw User's Guide, with the following exception.

Added features in SCS-Draw 1.1 require that you make one modification
to the copying procedure in Appendix E.  Step 5 on page 88 explains how
to use PIP to copy each Draw program file individually.  Page 88, however,
lists only three Draw files to copy.  Version 1.1 of SCS-Draw now includes
additional program files.  Therefore, substitute the following commands
for those shown in Step 5 so that you copy all seven Draw program files:

               A:=B:DRAW.COM[OV]
               A:=B:SAMPLE.DRW[OV]
               A:=B:SETDRAW.COM[OV]
               A:=B:PRINT.COM[OV]
               A:=B:DRAWFONT[OV]
               A:=B:DRAWHELP[OV]
               A:=B:DRAWPACK[OV]

KAYPRO 2'84 USERS (and others with single-sided disk drives):

Your working copy of SCS-Draw will be almost completely full, so it will
not have room to store new images that you create.  You can store images
on a disk in the other disk drive, however, by simply putting the drive
identifier before an image library name.  For example, if your working
copy of the SCS-Draw disk is in drive A: and a blank (formatted) disk is
in drive B:, enter DRAW B:MYSTUFF to open an image library called MYSTUFF
on the disk in drive B:.
